TDD pros and cons

Test-driven development, or TDD, is a software development methodology to target the coding process onto the passing of pre-defined tests. The biggest advantage of such approach would be its capability to produce highly testable code that clearly represents the requirements and needs. Also the code would be of minimal maintenance effort due to the comprehensive test coverage. 

However, the disadvantages of TDD could include overshooting the actual requirements that are infeasible to represent in unit tests. It could also be inconsiderate in covering in corner cases that deviate from the designed "happy cases".
